<h1>My personal portfolio</h1>
<h3><I>This is just a demo as how I just attempted making my personal portfolio website.<br>
Being a beginner,it took me more than 2 weeks to entirely go through every single stuff involved and worked vigorously on them so that it would be responsive to the greatest extent and I just took the help of multiple resources and then only I was able to manipulate that in my own way.I still need to work on that so that i can fix the remaining glitches.</I></h3><br>
